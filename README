py2scad: Create OpenSCAD 3D solid models using python

Do you prefer programming to drawing? Do you want a simple way to create
complicated 3D solid models using your favorite programing language? If so then
py2sacd may just be the thing for you. py2scad is a simple python library which
enables you write .scad files using python. py2scad is meant to be used in
conjuction with Clifford Wolff's great OpenSCAD program (http://openscad.org/).
Use py2scad to create the .scad version of your part and OpenSCAD to view your
part as you create it. 

Note, there are still some features that I need to implement: 

* The fn, fa, fs character should work on the global level, but you can yet set
  them for individual primatives as you can in openscad. 

* The lookup table function hasn't been implemented. This will be especiallly 
  useful for creating animations. 

Installations instructions can be found in the INSTALL file.
